# AppcologyBadChatbotClassifier
Copy and paste the code as noted in the comments and follow the instructions
for how to use it to set up classifiers and how to use it to classify messages.

stuff, but you definitely need to consider how to get around the shortcomings of just matching keywords
and be able to handle cases where there are multiple or no classifications.
